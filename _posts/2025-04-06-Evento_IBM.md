### **Empowering University Talent: A Generative AI Workshop with IBM**

On **April 10 and 11, 2025**, I had the joy of organizing a special workshop and class on **Generative Artificial Intelligence** at the National University. The guest speaker was **my friend Jorge Luis**, accompanied by his team: **Mariana Pulido and Santiago Cassiano**, who are currently working at **IBM**.

These events were more than just a class—they were an opportunity to **learn, get inspired, and connect with cutting-edge technology** right from our campus.



### 🌱 **Believing in Local Talent**

One of the reasons I’m so passionate about organizing these kinds of activities is that I **truly believe in the talent we have at the university**.

Every semester, I meet students with brilliant ideas, genuine curiosity, and a strong desire to learn. I’m convinced that **we can build cutting-edge projects right here**.

> "What we often lack isn’t talent, but spaces, support, and networks for collaboration."

Through my role, I want to contribute to that by **creating more opportunities to share knowledge, explore interests, and build challenging projects together**.



### **Bringing Talent to Inspire More Talent**

Inviting Jorge Luis was a small step in that direction. He himself **is a product of this university ecosystem**, and seeing how much he’s grown professionally and what he’s working on now is truly inspiring.

I believe that **when we bring back those who were once shaped by the university, we plant new seeds** in those currently filling the classrooms.

This event wasn’t just about generative AI or IBM—it was about **showing what’s possible** and opening new paths for future generations.



### **Organizing These Events: Something That Just Flows**

Interestingly, organizing this kind of initiative comes naturally to me. I find it easy to envision ideas, build teams, and bring projects to life.

Maybe it’s because I’m passionate about it.  
Maybe it’s because I love seeing people grow and learn.  
Maybe it’s because I also learn a lot in the process.

Whatever the reason, this workshop was another chance to reaffirm that commitment: **creating spaces where talent can flourish**.
