I have always been passionate about improving my community and making a positive impact on my surroundings. My fascination with solving mysteries naturally led me to study mathematics and computer science—two disciplines I believe are vital for tackling complex challenges.

Two years ago, I embarked on a self-guided journey into machine learning, which eventually led me to join [MindLab](https://ingenieria.unal.edu.co/mindlab/). This experience not only deepened my expertise in the field but also honed my leadership and social skills, as I took on roles that ensured the smooth functioning of essential projects.

Currently, I am delving into the cutting-edge field of continual learning while also mentoring first-year students. As I near the completion of my undergraduate degree, I am excited about the future opportunities to continue solving intricate problems and making meaningful contributions to my community.

### What drives me:

- Community engagement.
- Artistic expression.
- Creating and solving puzzles.
