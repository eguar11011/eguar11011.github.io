I have always had a deep interest in working to improve my community and positively contributing to my surroundings. Solving mysteries has been a passion that led me to pursue studies in mathematics and computer science, which I consider essential tools for unraveling the most complex problems.

Two years ago, I began learning about machine learning autonomously, which allowed me to join [MindLab][https://ingenieria.unal.edu.co/mindlab/], where I refined my knowledge in this fascinating field. My natural leadership drives me to ensure that everything fundamental works optimally, which has also strengthened my social skills.

Currently, I am exploring new frontiers in continual learning while working on a mentorship project for first-year students. I am about to complete my undergraduate degree and am excited about future opportunities where I can continue solving mysteries and contributing to my community.
