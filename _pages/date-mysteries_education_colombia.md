Did you know that in many schools in Colombia, students who do not pass their courses sometimes receive modified grades to pass? The question is: what benefits does this bring to the schools? Curiously, if a student stays longer in school, they would end up paying more tuition fees (matrículas), which could generate more income for the institution. It could be thought that this is done out of a philanthropic sense, to grant a high school diploma (bachiller) that allows the teenager to have a better future. However, speaking with some teachers, I have heard that some schools force teachers to pass students to maintain a good status in rankings. I wonder if this status translates into economic or other types of benefits for the school.

It's an interesting fact that makes me question whether this practice occurs in other countries, in which regions of Colombia it happens more frequently, and how it is affecting the country's development.

Initially, I think this complicates the work of teachers, as passing students who have not grasped basic concepts makes it difficult for them to learn more advanced topics. This could explain many issues in the educational system. However, it is true that having a diploma can open up more job opportunities.

Still, I believe that the real problem with education is not whether students are passed or not. The current method of teaching things that many do not want to learn and that are not useful for real life is the issue.

This phenomenon of passing students who have not mastered the subjects is simply a manifestation of the educational system's failure. Instead of addressing the root problem, what is happening here is that solutions are being created to cope with the system's challenges, and the apparent solution seems to be passing students.
